# Carlos Henrique's Portfolio Website
A responsive and performant portfolio website showcasing my work as a Full Stack Web Developer.

## Project Overview üì¶
This project leverages the Astro framework for blazing-fast builds, with static-site generation, and server-side rendering capabilities, all while following development best practices like Clean Code, TDD, and i18n.

## Getting Started üöÄ
### Prerequisites
* Node.js >= 14.0.0
* NPM or Yarn (install globally or use nvm)

### Setup
```bash
git clone [your-github-repo-url]
cd portfolio-website
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will set up a local development server and open the website in your browser at the default port specified in the configuration file (astro.config.mjs).

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
A production-ready build will be generated in the ./dist folder.

### Previewing the Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
This will start a local server with the production build for testing.

### Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
**Local Development**: Use `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Live Reloading: Changes to the source code will be reflected immediately in the browser.
- Type Checking: TypeScript with strict mode ensures type safety.

**Deploying:**
